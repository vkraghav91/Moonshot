# Moonshot
In this project we've builded an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program. We get more experience with Codable, but more importantly we have also worked with scroll views, navigation, and much more interesting layouts.

Yes, we've got some practice time with List, Text, and more, but we started to solve important SwiftUI problems – how can we make an image fit its space correctly? How can we clean up code using computed properties? How can we compose smaller views into larger ones to help keep our project organized?
